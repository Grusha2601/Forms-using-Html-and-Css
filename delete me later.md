things we ddi so far


you logged into github.com  -> created a repository called "forms using html and css"

later we tried to connect that repository to laptop 
on typing "git init" we realised that you don't have git instaled in your lapi 

so we downloaded git and just installed it .... got it ??
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

now we're going to connect "forms using html and css " repository to lapi
