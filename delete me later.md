things we ddi so far


you logged into github.com  -> created a repository called "forms using html and css"

later we tried to connect that repository to laptop 
on typing "git init" we realised that you don't have git instaled in your lapi 

so we downloaded git and just installed it .... got it ??
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

now we're going to connect "forms using html and css " repository to lapi



git status - to check if the folder is connected to github
git add .  - will add files to staging process 
git commit - will commit the changes 
git commit -m = we'll use this to write a message while commiting (example : "my initial commit")

git push - "will push the code to github 

if you 're confused try the options here
